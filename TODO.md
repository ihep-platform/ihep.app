## High Priority

### Digital Twin 3D Integration (BLOCKED - Session 6)

- [x] Install three-usdz-loader (with --legacy-peer-deps)
- [x] Move `components/digital-twin/` to `src/components/digital-twin/`

- [x] Fixed 2D/3D mode swap (conditions were inverted)

- [ ] **BLOCKED: Turbopack + Three.js bundling error** - See SESSION_HANDOFF.md for details
  - Error: `Module three/build/three.core.js not available`
  - Next.js 16.1.1 uses Turbopack by default

## Notes

- Project uses `src/app/` as the main app directory
- Path alias `@/*` maps to `./src/*`
- Path alias `@shared/*` maps to `./src/shared/*`
- Authentication uses NextAuth.js with credentials provider
- Mock store currently used for user data in development
- All dashboard pages protected with session check
